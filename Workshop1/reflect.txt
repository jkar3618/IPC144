1. Do you have any previous programming experience? if so, what language(s)? 
   If not, what are your initial thoughts about the C language and this course?

	- I do not have any previous programming experience. 
	  Before I attend this course, programming and C language is very difficult.
	  I think that this course will be helpful to get acknowledge of programming and C language. 

2. Describe your understanding of the comiling process of turning a C text file into an executable program.

	- C language statements can be converted into machine langrage equivalents by a C compiler.
	  We can type input and get output with the compiler. Then we call the input to the comipler
	  and the output from the compiler the binary code. 
	  It loads binary code into RAM and instructs the operating system to start executing that code.
	  After that, Users of the program provide input and receive output from it while the code is running.

3. What do you hope to achieve in this course? Describe your goals and expectations.

	- I can understand C language and how computer works.
	  Also, I expect that learning other languages like will be easier than learning C language first time after this course.
	  Moreover, I may get ability to solve any programming problem.
