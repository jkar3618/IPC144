1. Why are there three types of iteration constructs if we can make any one of them behave the same way? 
Refer to your code in this workshop to help backup your answer (do NOT include the code in your answer). 
Typically, when working with arrays, there is one iteration construct we favour â€“ what is it and explain why it is more
preferred over the other options.

		- I use three types of iteration constructs such as while loop, do while loop, and for loop. they have different specificities.
	Firstly, I can use while loops when a variable which is a flag has a value before the condition of while loop.
	Secondly, if the test expression is true, do while loop is executed again and the test expression is evaluated again until
	the test expression is false.
	Finally,  for loop is usually used when I know the number of times. also, It allows initialize variables, condition and
	update in one line.

		I used do while loop for most of the iteration and for loop to print the value of the array such as tabular data and notes about financing options.
	The reason is that I initialized the value of validvalue in do while loops and conditions of loops are !validvalue. 
	Also, I already know the number of times financing options. So I used for loops for the note about financing options



2. Describe what you did to both test and debug your program. How did you go about finding where the
problems were located (explain how you did this for both syntactic and semantic problems)?

	- In my case, if there are syntactical problems, the program does not run with an error message.
	Then, It tells me what kind of syntactical problem is in what number of lines. 
	Moreover, when there are semantical problems, the program runs anyway. However, it is not running perfectly.
	If there are any semantical problems, I usually do tests like a black box. Then, I do a walkthrough until I realize what the problems are.

3. When attempting to submit your work, you receive the following error feedback from the submitter:
Using the above explicit information, explain each step you must take to successfully identify and fix your error.

	- Sometimes I receive the following error feedback from the submitter. I show what is the problem.
	Then I find the error in the feedback. I debug, black box, and walkthrough. After that, I solve the problems.
	If there is any error feedback from the submitter, I do it again and again until my workshop is submitted.
